# Automated Tests for Galaxy on Kubernetes Stacks
## Deployment testing
Twice a day, [GalaxyKubeMan (GKM)](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxykubeman-helm) is deployed on GKE, mimicking an AnVIL deployment. The purpose of these tests is to provide reasonable confidence that Galaxy can be launched on the AnVIL everyday.

Below is a plot summarizing successful deployments and GKM install times.

## Tool testing
After each successful deployment, automated tool tests are also run against the instance. These serve as an end-to-end-like test for Galaxy, providing confidence that Galaxy deployments are functional. These tests cycle on a weekly basis through the entire suite of tools installed by default on AnVIL, providing reasonable confidence that the tools encountered by most users remain functional, and automating the detection and reporting of tools breaking.
