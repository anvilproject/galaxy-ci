            Starting Unicycler (2024-10-01 13:24:04)    Welcome to Unicycler, an assembly pipeline for bacterial genomes. Since youprovided only short reads, Unicycler will essentially function as a SPAdes-optimiser. It will try many k-mer sizes, choose the best based on contig lengthand graph connectivity, and scaffold the graph using SPAdes repeat resolution.    For more information, please see https://github.com/rrwick/UnicyclerCommand: /usr/local/bin/unicycler -t 8 -o ./ --verbosity 3 -1 fq1.fastq -2 fq2.fastq --mode normal --min_fasta_length 100 --linear_seqs 0 --min_kmer_frac 0.2 --max_kmer_frac 0.95 --kmer_count 10 --depth_filter 0.25 --start_gene_id 90.0 --start_gene_cov 95.0 --min_component_size 1000 --min_dead_end_size 1000 --scores 3,-6,-5,-2 --keep 0Unicycler version: v0.5.1Using 8 threadsThe output directory already exists and files may be reused or overwritten:  /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/154/workingBridging mode: normal  using default normal bridge quality cutoff: 10.00Dependencies:  Program       Version   Status     Path                        spades.py     4.0.0     good       /usr/local/bin/spades.py    racon                   not used                               makeblastdb   2.16.0+   good       /usr/local/bin/makeblastdb  tblastn       2.16.0+   good       /usr/local/bin/tblastn    Choosing k-mer range for assembly (2024-10-01 13:24:05)    Unicycler chooses a k-mer range for SPAdes based on the length of the inputreads. It uses a wide range of many k-mer sizes to maximise the chance offinding an ideal assembly.SPAdes maximum k-mer: 127Median read length: 251K-mer range: 27, 47, 63, 77, 89, 99, 107, 115, 121, 127SPAdes assemblies (2024-10-01 13:24:05)    Unicycler now uses SPAdes to assemble the short reads. It scores theassembly graph for each k-mer using the number of contigs (fewer is better) andthe number of dead ends (fewer is better). The score function is 1/(c*(d+2)),where c is the contig count and d is the dead end count.spades.py -o /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/154/working/spades_assembly -k 27 --threads 8 --gfa11 --isolate -1 /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/154/working/fq1.fastq -2 /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/154/working/fq2.fastq -m 1024== Warning ==  output dir is not empty!

(2024-10-01 13:26:25)    Multiplicity is the number of times a sequence occurs in the underlyingsequence. Single-copy contigs (those with a multiplicity of one, occurring onlyonce in the underlying sequence) are particularly useful.    Multiplicity determination begins by identifying contigs which are clearlysingle-copy because they are of low depth and do not have more than one linkper side.Median depth of 10 longest contigs: 1.00Initial single copy segments:    1    Unicycler now uses a greedy algorithm to propagate multiplicity through thegraph. For example, if two single-copy contigs merge together, the resultingcontig will get a multiplicity of two. When no more propagation is possible,additional single-copy contigs are added and the process is repeated.

SPAdes saves the graph pathscorresponding to these contigs in the contigs.paths file.

It then uses the read depth of themiddle and repeat contigs to guess the number of times to traverse the loop andmakes a bridge.No loop unrolling bridges madenone foundApplying bridges (2024-10-01 13:26:25)    Unicycler now applies to the graph in decreasing order of quality.

            Starting Unicycler (2024-10-01 13:27:07)    Welcome to Unicycler, an assembly pipeline for bacterial genomes. Since youprovided both short and long reads, Unicycler will perform a hybrid assembly.It will first use SPAdes to make a short-read assembly graph, and then it willuse various methods to scaffold that graph with the long reads.    For more information, please see https://github.com/rrwick/UnicyclerCommand: /usr/local/bin/unicycler -t 8 -o ./ --verbosity 3 -1 fq1.fastq.gz -2 fq2.fastq.gz -l lr.fasta --mode normal --min_fasta_length 100 --linear_seqs 0 --min_kmer_frac 0.2 --max_kmer_frac 0.95 --kmer_count 10 --depth_filter 0.25 --start_gene_id 90.0 --start_gene_cov 95.0 --min_component_size 1000 --min_dead_end_size 1000 --scores 3,-6,-5,-2 --keep 0Unicycler version: v0.5.1Using 8 threadsThe output directory already exists and files may be reused or overwritten:  /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/158/workingBridging mode: normal  using default normal bridge quality cutoff: 10.00Dependencies:  Program       Version   Status   Path                        spades.py     4.0.0     good     /usr/local/bin/spades.py    racon         1.5.0     good     /usr/local/bin/racon        makeblastdb   2.16.0+   good     /usr/local/bin/makeblastdb  tblastn       2.16.0+   good     /usr/local/bin/tblastn    Choosing k-mer range for assembly (2024-10-01 13:27:08)    Unicycler chooses a k-mer range for SPAdes based on the length of the inputreads. It uses a wide range of many k-mer sizes to maximise the chance offinding an ideal assembly.SPAdes maximum k-mer: 127Median read length: 251K-mer range: 27, 47, 63, 77, 89, 99, 107, 115, 121, 127SPAdes assemblies (2024-10-01 13:27:08)    Unicycler now uses SPAdes to assemble the short reads. It scores theassembly graph for each k-mer using the number of contigs (fewer is better) andthe number of dead ends (fewer is better). The score function is 1/(c*(d+2)),where c is the contig count and d is the dead end count.spades.py -o /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/158/working/spades_assembly -k 27 --threads 8 --gfa11 --isolate -1 /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/158/working/fq1.fastq.gz -2 /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/158/working/fq2.fastq.gz -m 1024== Warning ==  output dir is not empty!

(2024-10-01 13:29:29)    Multiplicity is the number of times a sequence occurs in the underlyingsequence. Single-copy contigs (those with a multiplicity of one, occurring onlyonce in the underlying sequence) are particularly useful.    Multiplicity determination begins by identifying contigs which are clearlysingle-copy because they are of low depth and do not have more than one linkper side.Median depth of 10 longest contigs: 1.00Initial single copy segments:    1    Unicycler now uses a greedy algorithm to propagate multiplicity through thegraph. For example, if two single-copy contigs merge together, the resultingcontig will get a multiplicity of two. When no more propagation is possible,additional single-copy contigs are added and the process is repeated. Thisallows for multiplicity to be correctly assigned to the chromosome (at themedian depth) but also for plasmids (which may be higher or lower in depth).

When one of thesepaths contains two or more anchor contigs, Unicycler can create a bridge fromthe path.No SPAdes contig bridgesCreating loop unrolling bridges (2024-10-01 13:29:29)    When a SPAdes contig path connects an anchor contig with the middle contigof a simple loop, Unicycler concludes that the sequences are contiguous (i.e.the loop is not a separate piece of DNA). It then uses the read depth of themiddle and repeat contigs to guess the number of times to traverse the loop andmakes a bridge.No loop unrolling bridges madenone foundLoading reads (2024-10-01 13:29:29)0 / 1 (0.0%)1 / 1 (100.0%) - 5,386 bp1 / 1 (100.0%) - 5,386 bpAssembling contigs and long reads with miniasm (2024-10-01 13:29:29)    Unicycler uses miniasm to construct a string graph assembly using both theshort read contigs and the long reads. It will then use the resulting stringgraph to produce bridges between contigs. This method requires decent coverageof long reads and therefore may not be fruitful if long reads are sparse.However, it does not rely on the short read assembly graph having goodconnectivity and is able to bridge an assembly graph even when it contains manydead ends.    Unicycler uses two types of "reads" as assembly input: anchor contigs fromthe short-read assembly and actual long reads which overlap two or more ofthese contigs. It then assembles them with miniasm.Aligning long reads to graph using minimapSaving /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/158/working/miniasm_assembly/all_segments.fasta1538635158+15386227538251555155255cm:i:11491538651635383+153861221220220255cm:i:47Number of minimap alignments: 1Saving to /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/158/working/miniasm_assembly/01_assembly_reads.fastq:  0 short-read contigs  1 long readsFinding overlaps with minimap... failedAssembling reads with miniasm... empty resultCreating simple long read bridges (2024-10-01 13:29:29)    Unicycler uses long read alignments (from minimap) to resolve simple repeatstructures in the graph. This takes care of some "low-hanging fruit" of thegraph simplification.Aligning long reads to graph using minimapSaving /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/158/working/simple_bridging/all_segments.fasta1538635158+15386227538251555155255cm:i:11491538651635383+153861221220220255cm:i:47Number of minimap alignments: 1    Two-way junctions are defined as cases where two graph contigs (A and B)join together (C) and then split apart again (D and E). This usually representsa simple 2-copy repeat, and there are two possible options for its resolution:(A->C->D and B->C->E) or (A->C->E and B->C->D). Each read which spans such ajunction gets to "vote" for option 1, option 2 or neither. Unicycler creates abridge at each junction for the most voted for option.No suitable two-way junctions present    Simple loops are parts of the graph where two contigs (A and B) areconnected via a repeat (C) which loops back to itself (via D). It is possibleto traverse the loop zero times (A->C->B), one time (A->C->D->C->B), two times(A->C->D->C->D->C->B), etc. Long reads which span the loop inform which is thecorrect number of times through. In this step, such reads are found and each isaligned against alternative loop counts. A reads casts its "vote" for the loopcount it agrees best with, and Unicycler creates a bridge using the most votedfor count.No suitable simple loops presentDetermining low score threshold (2024-10-01 13:29:29)    Before conducting semi-global alignment of the long reads to the assemblygraph, Unicycler must determine a minimum alignment score threshold such thatnonsense alignments are excluded.

            Starting Unicycler (2024-10-01 13:33:41)    Welcome to Unicycler, an assembly pipeline for bacterial genomes. Since youprovided both short and long reads, Unicycler will perform a hybrid assembly.It will first use SPAdes to make a short-read assembly graph, and then it willuse various methods to scaffold that graph with the long reads.

Single-copy contigs (those with a multiplicity of one, occurring onlyonce in the underlying sequence) are particularly useful.    Multiplicity determination begins by identifying contigs which are clearlysingle-copy because they are of low depth and do not have more than one linkper side.Median depth of 10 longest contigs: 1.00Initial single copy segments: none    Unicycler now uses a greedy algorithm to propagate multiplicity through thegraph. For example, if two single-copy contigs merge together, the resultingcontig will get a multiplicity of two. When no more propagation is possible,additional single-copy contigs are added and the process is repeated. Thisallows for multiplicity to be correctly assigned to the chromosome (at themedian depth) but also for plasmids (which may be higher or lower in depth).

The end result is a graph ready forbridging.Grouping graph edges based on overlap removal0 / 4 (0.0%)1 / 4 (25.0%)2 / 4 (50.0%)3 / 4 (75.0%)4 / 4 (100.0%)Removing graph overlaps             Bases     Bases           trimmed   trimmed Segment      from      from  number     start       end       1        64        63       2        63        64Graph overlaps removedRemoved zero-length segments:    2    Unicycler now selects a set of anchor contigs from the single-copy contigs.These are the contigs which will be connected via bridges to form the finalassembly.1 anchor segments (5,386 bp) out of 1 total segments (5,386 bp)Anchor segments:    1Creating SPAdes contig bridges (2024-10-01 13:33:42)    SPAdes uses paired-end information to perform repeat resolution (RR) andproduce contigs from the assembly graph. SPAdes saves the graph pathscorresponding to these contigs in the contigs.paths file. When one of thesepaths contains two or more anchor contigs, Unicycler can create a bridge fromthe path.No SPAdes contig bridgesCreating loop unrolling bridges (2024-10-01 13:33:42)    When a SPAdes contig path connects an anchor contig with the middle contigof a simple loop, Unicycler concludes that the sequences are contiguous (i.e.the loop is not a separate piece of DNA). It then uses the read depth of themiddle and repeat contigs to guess the number of times to traverse the loop andmakes a bridge.No loop unrolling bridges madenone foundLoading reads (2024-10-01 13:33:42)0 / 40 (0.0%)1 / 40 (2.5%) - 412 bp2 / 40 (5.0%) - 4,847 bp3 / 40 (7.5%) - 8,974 bp4 / 40 (10.0%) - 13,249 bp5 / 40 (12.5%) - 14,258 bp6 / 40 (15.0%) - 14,806 bp7 / 40 (17.5%) - 19,262 bp8 / 40 (20.0%) - 19,737 bp9 / 40 (22.5%) - 20,395 bp10 / 40 (25.0%) - 32,024 bp11 / 40 (27.5%) - 32,698 bp12 / 40 (30.0%) - 34,509 bp13 / 40 (32.5%) - 39,018 bp14 / 40 (35.0%) - 43,351 bp15 / 40 (37.5%) - 44,224 bp16 / 40 (40.0%) - 45,978 bp17 / 40 (42.5%) - 46,402 bp18 / 40 (45.0%) - 61,596 bp19 / 40 (47.5%) - 62,279 bp20 / 40 (50.0%) - 63,700 bp21 / 40 (52.5%) - 66,412 bp22 / 40 (55.0%) - 66,845 bp23 / 40 (57.5%) - 67,316 bp24 / 40 (60.0%) - 69,428 bp25 / 40 (62.5%) - 73,964 bp26 / 40 (65.0%) - 75,608 bp27 / 40 (67.5%) - 80,223 bp28 / 40 (70.0%) - 84,810 bp29 / 40 (72.5%) - 92,076 bp30 / 40 (75.0%) - 92,832 bp31 / 40 (77.5%) - 92,939 bp32 / 40 (80.0%) - 93,532 bp33 / 40 (82.5%) - 96,370 bp34 / 40 (85.0%) - 100,656 bp35 / 40 (87.5%) - 119,222 bp36 / 40 (90.0%) - 123,827 bp37 / 40 (92.5%) - 155,106 bp38 / 40 (95.0%) - 156,254 bp39 / 40 (97.5%) - 157,993 bp40 / 40 (100.0%) - 162,406 bp40 / 40 (100.0%) - 162,406 bpAssembling contigs and long reads with miniasm (2024-10-01 13:33:42)    Unicycler uses miniasm to construct a string graph assembly using both theshort read contigs and the long reads. It will then use the resulting stringgraph to produce bridges between contigs. This method requires decent coverageof long reads and therefore may not be fruitful if long reads are sparse.However, it does not rely on the short read assembly graph having goodconnectivity and is able to bridge an assembly graph even when it contains manydead ends.    Unicycler uses two types of "reads" as assembly input: anchor contigs fromthe short-read assembly and actual long reads which overlap two or more ofthese contigs.

This usually representsa simple 2-copy repeat, and there are two possible options for its resolution:(A->C->D and B->C->E) or (A->C->E and B->C->D). Each read which spans such ajunction gets to "vote" for option 1, option 2 or neither. Unicycler creates abridge at each junction for the most voted for option.No suitable two-way junctions present    Simple loops are parts of the graph where two contigs (A and B) areconnected via a repeat (C) which loops back to itself (via D). It is possibleto traverse the loop zero times (A->C->B), one time (A->C->D->C->B), two times(A->C->D->C->D->C->B), etc. Long reads which span the loop inform which is thecorrect number of times through. In this step, such reads are found and each isaligned against alternative loop counts. A reads casts its "vote" for the loopcount it agrees best with, and Unicycler creates a bridge using the most votedfor count.No suitable simple loops presentDetermining low score threshold (2024-10-01 13:33:42)    Before conducting semi-global alignment of the long reads to the assemblygraph, Unicycler must determine a minimum alignment score threshold such thatnonsense alignments are excluded. To choose a threshold automatically, itexamines alignments between random sequences and selects a score a few standarddeviations above the mean.Automatically choosing a threshold using random alignment scores.Random alignment mean score: 61.66         standard deviation:  1.31        Low score threshold: 61.66 + (7 x 1.31) = 70.86Aligning reads with minimap (2024-10-01 13:33:42)Done! 0 out

Since youprovided both short and long reads, Unicycler will perform a hybrid assembly.It will first use SPAdes to make a short-read assembly graph, and then it willuse various methods to scaffold that graph with the long reads.

It uses a wide range of many k-mer sizes to maximise the chance offinding an ideal assembly.SPAdes maximum k-mer: 127Median read length: 251K-mer range: 27, 47, 63, 77, 89, 99, 107, 115, 121, 127SPAdes assemblies (2024-10-01 13:34:46)    Unicycler now uses SPAdes to assemble the short reads. It scores theassembly graph for each k-mer using the number of contigs (fewer is better) andthe number of dead ends (fewer is better).

Multiplicity is the number of times a sequence occurs in the underlyingsequence. Single-copy contigs (those with a multiplicity of one, occurring onlyonce in the underlying sequence) are particularly useful.    Multiplicity determination begins by identifying contigs which are clearlysingle-copy because they are of low depth and do not have more than one linkper side.Median depth of 10 longest contigs: 1.00Initial single copy segments:    1    Unicycler now uses a greedy algorithm to propagate multiplicity through thegraph. For example, if two single-copy contigs merge together, the resultingcontig will get a multiplicity of two. When no more propagation is possible,additional single-copy contigs are added and the process is repeated. Thisallows for multiplicity to be correctly assigned to the chromosome (at themedian depth) but also for plasmids (which may be higher or lower in depth).

SPAdes saves the graph pathscorresponding to these contigs in the contigs.paths file. When one of thesepaths contains two or more anchor contigs, Unicycler can create a bridge fromthe path.No SPAdes contig bridgesCreating loop unrolling bridges (2024-10-01 13:37:06)    When a SPAdes contig path connects an anchor contig with the middle contigof a simple loop, Unicycler concludes that the sequences are contiguous (i.e.the loop is not a separate piece of DNA). It then uses the read depth of themiddle and repeat contigs to guess the number of times to traverse the loop andmakes a bridge.No loop unrolling bridges madenone foundLoading reads (2024-10-01 13:37:06)0 / 1 (0.0%)1 / 1 (100.0%) - 5,386 bp1 / 1 (100.0%) - 5,386 bpAssembling contigs and long reads with miniasm (2024-10-01 13:37:06)    Unicycler uses miniasm to construct a string graph assembly using both theshort read contigs and the long reads. It will then use the resulting stringgraph to produce bridges between contigs. This method requires decent coverageof long reads and therefore may not be fruitful if long reads are sparse.However, it does not rely on the short read assembly graph having goodconnectivity and is able to bridge an assembly graph even when it contains manydead ends.    Unicycler uses two types of "reads" as assembly input: anchor contigs fromthe short-read assembly and actual long reads which overlap two or more ofthese contigs.

This usually representsa simple 2-copy repeat, and there are two possible options for its resolution:(A->C->D and B->C->E) or (A->C->E and B->C->D). Each read which spans such ajunction gets to "vote" for option 1, option 2 or neither. Unicycler creates abridge at each junction for the most voted for option.No suitable two-way junctions present    Simple loops are parts of the graph where two contigs (A and B) areconnected via a repeat (C) which loops back to itself (via D). It is possibleto traverse the loop zero times (A->C->B), one time (A->C->D->C->B), two times(A->C->D->C->D->C->B), etc. Long reads which span the loop inform which is thecorrect number of times through. In this step, such reads are found and each isaligned against alternative loop counts. A reads casts its "vote" for the loopcount it agrees best with, and Unicycler creates a bridge using the most votedfor count.No suitable simple loops presentDetermining low score threshold (2024-10-01 13:37:06)    Before conducting semi-global alignment of the long reads to the assemblygraph, Unicycler must determine a minimum alignment score threshold such thatnonsense alignments are excluded.

It uses a wide range of many k-mer sizes to maximise the chance offinding an ideal assembly.SPAdes maximum k-mer: 127Median read length: 251K-mer range: 27, 47, 63, 77, 89, 99, 107, 115, 121, 127SPAdes assemblies (2024-10-01 13:37:54)    Unicycler now uses SPAdes to assemble the short reads. It scores theassembly graph for each k-mer using the number of contigs (fewer is better) andthe number of dead ends (fewer is better). The score function is 1/(c*(d+2)),where c is the contig count and d is the dead end count.spades.py -o /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/178/working/spades_assembly -k 27 --threads 8 --gfa11 --isolate -1 /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/178/working/fq1.fastq -2 /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/178/working/fq2.fastq -m 1024== Warning ==  output dir is not empty!

(2024-10-01 13:40:18)    Multiplicity is the number of times a sequence occurs in the underlyingsequence. Single-copy contigs (those with a multiplicity of one, occurring onlyonce in the underlying sequence) are particularly useful.    Multiplicity determination begins by identifying contigs which are clearlysingle-copy because they are of low depth and do not have more than one linkper side.Median depth of 10 longest contigs: 1.00Initial single copy segments:    1    Unicycler now uses a greedy algorithm to propagate multiplicity through thegraph. For example, if two single-copy contigs merge together, the resultingcontig will get a multiplicity of two. When no more propagation is possible,additional single-copy contigs are added and the process is repeated. Thisallows for multiplicity to be correctly assigned to the chromosome (at themedian depth) but also for plasmids (which may be higher or lower in depth).

SPAdes saves the graph pathscorresponding to these contigs in the contigs.paths file. When one of thesepaths contains two or more anchor contigs, Unicycler can create a bridge fromthe path.No SPAdes contig bridgesCreating loop unrolling bridges (2024-10-01 13:40:18)    When a SPAdes contig path connects an anchor contig with the middle contigof a simple loop, Unicycler concludes that the sequences are contiguous (i.e.the loop is not a separate piece of DNA). It then uses the read depth of themiddle and repeat contigs to guess the number of times to traverse the loop andmakes a bridge.No loop unrolling bridges madenone foundLoading reads (2024-10-01 13:40:18)0 / 1 (0.0%)1 / 1 (100.0%) - 5,386 bp1 / 1 (100.0%) - 5,386 bpAssembling contigs and long reads with miniasm (2024-10-01 13:40:18)    Unicycler uses miniasm to construct a string graph assembly using both theshort read contigs and the long reads. It will then use the resulting stringgraph to produce bridges between contigs. This method requires decent coverageof long reads and therefore may not be fruitful if long reads are sparse.However, it does not rely on the short read assembly graph having goodconnectivity and is able to bridge an assembly graph even when it contains manydead ends.    Unicycler uses two types of "reads" as assembly input: anchor contigs fromthe short-read assembly and actual long reads which overlap two or more ofthese contigs. It then assembles them with miniasm.Aligning long reads to graph using minimapSaving /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/178/working/miniasm_assembly/all_segments.fasta1538635158+15386227538251555155255cm:i:11491538651635383+153861221220220255cm:i:47Number of minimap alignments: 1Saving to /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/178/working/miniasm_assembly/01_assembly_reads.fastq:  0 short-read contigs  1 long readsFinding overlaps with minimap... failedAssembling reads with miniasm... empty resultDetermining low score threshold (2024-10-01 13:40:18)    Before conducting semi-global alignment of the long reads to the assemblygraph, Unicycler must determine a minimum alignment score threshold such thatnonsense alignments are excluded.

For consistency, Unicycler now searches for a starting gene (dnaAor repA) in each such contig, and if one is found, the contig is rotated tostart with that gene on the forward strand.Segment 1:  makeblastdb -dbtype nucl -in replicon.fasta  tblastn -db replicon.fasta -query /usr/local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/unicycler/gene_data/start_genes.fasta -outfmt 6 qseqid sstart send pident qlen qseq qstart bitscore -num_threads 1Segment   Length   Depth   Starting gene   Position   Strand   Identity   Coverage      1    5,386   1.00x   none found                                             Assembly complete (2024-10-01 13:40:27)Saving /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/178/working/assembly.gfaSaving /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/178/working/assembly.fasta
