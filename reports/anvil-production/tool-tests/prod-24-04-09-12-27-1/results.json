It will try many k-mer sizes, choose the best based on contig length\nand graph connectivity, and scaffold the graph using SPAdes repeat resolution.\n    For more information, please see https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler\n\nCommand: /usr/local/bin/unicycler -t 8 -o ./ --verbosity 3 --pilon_path /usr/local/share/pilon-1.24-0/pilon.jar -1 fq1.fastq -2 fq2.fastq --mode normal --min_fasta_length 100 --linear_seqs 0 --no_correct --min_kmer_frac 0.2 --max_kmer_frac 0.95 --kmer_count 10 --depth_filter 0.25 --start_gene_id 90.0 --start_gene_cov 95.0 --min_polish_size 1000 --min_component_size 1000 --min_dead_end_size 1000 --scores 3,-6,-5,-2\n\nUnicycler version: v0.4.8\nUsing 8 threads\n\nThe output directory already exists and files may be reused or overwritten:\n  /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/93/working\n\nBridging mode: normal\n  using default normal bridge quality cutoff: 10.00\n\nDependencies:\n  Program         Version             Status     Path                                   \n  spades.py       3.14.1              good       /usr/local/bin/spades.py               \n  racon                               not used                                          \n  makeblastdb     2.12.0+             good       /usr/local/bin/makeblastdb             \n  tblastn         2.12.0+             good       /usr/local/bin/tblastn                 \n  bowtie2-build   2.4.4               good       /usr/local/bin/bowtie2-build           \n  bowtie2         2.4.4               good       /usr/local/bin/bowtie2                 \n  samtools        1.14                good       /usr/local/bin/samtools                \n  java            11.0.9.1-internal   good       /usr/local/bin/java                    \n  pilon           1.24                good       /usr/local/share/pilon-1.24-0/pilon.jar\n  bcftools                            not used                                          \n\n\nChoosing k-mer range for assembly (2024-04-09 13:10:25)\n    Unicycler chooses a k-mer range for SPAdes based on the length of the input\nreads. It uses a wide range of many k-mer sizes to maximise the chance of\nfinding an ideal assembly.\n\nSPAdes maximum k-mer: 127\nMedian read length: 251\nK-mer range: 27, 47, 63, 77, 89, 99, 107, 115, 121, 127\n\n\nSPAdes assemblies (2024-04-09 13:10:25)\n    Unicycler now uses SPAdes to assemble the short reads. It scores the\nassembly graph for each k-mer using the number of contigs (fewer is better) and\nthe number of dead ends (fewer is better). The score function is 1/(c*(d+2)),\nwhere c is the contig count and d is the dead end count.\n\n== Warning ==  No assembly mode was specified!

Single-copy contigs (those with a multiplicity of one, occurring only\nonce in the underlying sequence) are particularly useful.\n    Multiplicity determination begins by identifying contigs which are clearly\nsingle-copy because they are of low depth and do not have more than one link\nper side.\n\nMedian depth of 10 longest contigs: 1.00\n\n\nInitial single copy segments:\n    1\n\n    Unicycler now uses a greedy algorithm to propagate multiplicity through the\ngraph. For example, if two single-copy contigs merge together, the resulting\ncontig will get a multiplicity of two. When no more propagation is possible,\nadditional single-copy contigs are added and the process is repeated. This\nallows for multiplicity to be correctly assigned to the chromosome (at the\nmedian depth) but also for plasmids (which may be higher or lower in depth).\n\n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n       FINDING NEW SINGLE-COPY        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \nREMOVING PROPAGATION TOLERANCE        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n\nSaving /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/93/working/001_best_spades_graph.gfa\n\n\nCleaning graph (2024-04-09 13:12:01)\n    Unicycler now performs various cleaning procedures on the graph to remove\noverlaps and simplify the graph structure.

SPAdes saves the graph paths\ncorresponding to these contigs in the contigs.paths file.

It then uses the read depth of the\nmiddle and repeat contigs to guess the number of times to traverse the loop and\nmakes a bridge.\n\nNo loop unrolling bridges made\nnone found\n\n\nApplying bridges (2024-04-09 13:12:01)\n    Unicycler now applies to the graph in decreasing order of quality. This\nensures that when multiple, contradictory bridges exist, the most supported\noption is used.\n\nBridge type   Start -> end   Path   Quality   Result\n\nSaving /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/93/working/003_bridges_applied.gfa\n\n\nCleaning up leftover segments (2024-04-09 13:12:01)\nSegments eligible for deletion:\n\n\nBridged assembly graph (2024-04-09 13:12:01)\n    The assembly is now mostly finished and no more structural changes will be\nmade.

Single-copy contigs (those with a multiplicity of one, occurring only\nonce in the underlying sequence) are particularly useful.\n    Multiplicity determination begins by identifying contigs which are clearly\nsingle-copy because they are of low depth and do not have more than one link\nper side.\n\nMedian depth of 10 longest contigs: 1.00\n\n\nInitial single copy segments:\n    1\n\n    Unicycler now uses a greedy algorithm to propagate multiplicity through the\ngraph. For example, if two single-copy contigs merge together, the resulting\ncontig will get a multiplicity of two. When no more propagation is possible,\nadditional single-copy contigs are added and the process is repeated. This\nallows for multiplicity to be correctly assigned to the chromosome (at the\nmedian depth) but also for plasmids (which may be higher or lower in depth).\n\n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n       FINDING NEW SINGLE-COPY        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \nREMOVING PROPAGATION TOLERANCE        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n\nSaving /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/93/working/001_best_spades_graph.gfa\n\n\nCleaning graph (2024-04-09 13:12:01)\n    Unicycler now performs various cleaning procedures on the graph to remove\noverlaps and simplify the graph structure.

It then uses the read depth of the\nmiddle and repeat contigs to guess the number of times to traverse the loop and\nmakes a bridge.\n\nNo loop unrolling bridges made\nnone found\n\n\nApplying bridges (2024-04-09 13:12:01)\n    Unicycler now applies to the graph in decreasing order of quality.

Single-copy contigs (those with a multiplicity of one, occurring only\nonce in the underlying sequence) are particularly useful.\n    Multiplicity determination begins by identifying contigs which are clearly\nsingle-copy because they are of low depth and do not have more than one link\nper side.\n\nMedian depth of 10 longest contigs: 1.00\n\n\nInitial single copy segments:\n    1\n\n    Unicycler now uses a greedy algorithm to propagate multiplicity through the\ngraph. For example, if two single-copy contigs merge together, the resulting\ncontig will get a multiplicity of two. When no more propagation is possible,\nadditional single-copy contigs are added and the process is repeated. This\nallows for multiplicity to be correctly assigned to the chromosome (at the\nmedian depth) but also for plasmids (which may be higher or lower in depth).\n\n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n       FINDING NEW SINGLE-COPY        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \nREMOVING PROPAGATION TOLERANCE        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n\nSaving /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/97/working/001_best_spades_graph.gfa\n\n\nCleaning graph (2024-04-09 13:14:25)\n    Unicycler now performs various cleaning procedures on the graph to remove\noverlaps and simplify the graph structure.

It will then use the resulting string\ngraph to produce bridges between contigs. This method requires decent coverage\nof long reads and therefore may not be fruitful if long reads are sparse.\nHowever, it does not rely on the short read assembly graph having good\nconnectivity and is able to bridge an assembly graph even when it contains many\ndead ends.\n    Unicycler uses two types of \"reads\" as assembly input: anchor contigs from\nthe short-read assembly and actual long reads which overlap two or more of\nthese contigs.

This usually represents\na simple 2-copy repeat, and there are two possible options for its resolution:\n(A->C->D and B->C->E) or (A->C->E and B->C->D).

It is possible\nto traverse the loop zero times (A->C->B), one time (A->C->D->C->B), two times\n(A->C->D->C->D->C->B), etc. Long reads which span the loop inform which is the\ncorrect number of times through. In this step, such reads are found and each is\naligned against alternative loop counts. A reads casts its \"vote\" for the loop\ncount it agrees best with, and Unicycler creates a bridge using the most voted\nfor count.\n\nNo suitable simple loops present\n\n\nDetermining low score threshold (2024-04-09 13:14:25)\n    Before conducting semi-global alignment of the long reads to the assembly\ngraph, Unicycler must determine a minimum alignment score threshold such that\nnonsense alignments are excluded.

Single-copy contigs (those with a multiplicity of one, occurring only\nonce in the underlying sequence) are particularly useful.\n    Multiplicity determination begins by identifying contigs which are clearly\nsingle-copy because they are of low depth and do not have more than one link\nper side.\n\nMedian depth of 10 longest contigs: 1.00\n\n\nInitial single copy segments:\n    1\n\n    Unicycler now uses a greedy algorithm to propagate multiplicity through the\ngraph. For example, if two single-copy contigs merge together, the resulting\ncontig will get a multiplicity of two. When no more propagation is possible,\nadditional single-copy contigs are added and the process is repeated. This\nallows for multiplicity to be correctly assigned to the chromosome (at the\nmedian depth) but also for plasmids (which may be higher or lower in depth).\n\n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n       FINDING NEW SINGLE-COPY        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \nREMOVING PROPAGATION TOLERANCE        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n\nSaving /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/97/working/001_best_spades_graph.gfa\n\n\nCleaning graph (2024-04-09 13:14:25)\n    Unicycler now performs various cleaning procedures on the graph to remove\noverlaps and simplify the graph structure.

It will then use the resulting string\ngraph to produce bridges between contigs. This method requires decent coverage\nof long reads and therefore may not be fruitful if long reads are sparse.\nHowever, it does not rely on the short read assembly graph having good\nconnectivity and is able to bridge an assembly graph even when it contains many\ndead ends.\n    Unicycler uses two types of \"reads\" as assembly input: anchor contigs from\nthe short-read assembly and actual long reads which overlap two or more of\nthese contigs.

This usually represents\na simple 2-copy repeat, and there are two possible options for its resolution:\n(A->C->D and B->C->E) or (A->C->E and B->C->D).

It is possible\nto traverse the loop zero times (A->C->B), one time (A->C->D->C->B), two times\n(A->C->D->C->D->C->B), etc. Long reads which span the loop inform which is the\ncorrect number of times through. In this step, such reads are found and each is\naligned against alternative loop counts. A reads casts its \"vote\" for the loop\ncount it agrees best with, and Unicycler creates a bridge using the most voted\nfor count.\n\nNo suitable simple loops present\n\n\nDetermining low score threshold (2024-04-09 13:14:25)\n    Before conducting semi-global alignment of the long reads to the assembly\ngraph, Unicycler must determine a minimum alignment score threshold such that\nnonsense alignments are excluded. To choose a threshold automatically, it\nexamines alignments between random sequences and selects a score a few standard\ndeviations above the mean.\n\nAutomatically choosing a threshold using random alignment scores.\n\nRandom alignment mean score: 61.66\n         standard deviation:  1.31\n        Low score threshold: 61.66 + (7 x 1.31) = 70.86\n\n\nAligning reads with minimap (2024-04-09 13:14:25)\n1\t5386\t5\t5077\t-\t1\t5386\t8\t5080\t5072\t5072\t255\tcm:i:945\n1\t5386\t5093\t5384\t-\t1\t5386\t5087\t5378\t291\t291\t255\tcm:i:52\n\nDone! 1 out of 1 reads aligned\n\n\nAligning reads (2024-04-09 13:14:25)\n1/1: 1 (5386 bp)\nminimap alignments:\n    5,5077,-,1,8,5080\n    5093,5384,-,1,5087,5378\nReference ranges:\n    1-: 0 - 5386\nRange: 1: 0 - 5386\n    common 10-mers: 5464\n    line 1: 5076 points, score=5074.000394 (good)\n    line 2: 292 points, score=290.006826 (good)\nAll Seqan alignments (time to align = 0.039 s):\n  Ref name  Ref start  Ref end  Read start  Read end  Strand  Raw score  Scaled score  Identity\n         1          0     5085           0      5085       -      15255        100.00   100.00%\n         1       5085     5386        5085      5386       -        903        100.00   100.00%\nFinal alignments:\n  Ref name  Ref start  Ref end  Read start  Read end  Strand  Raw score  Scaled score  Identity\n         1          0     5085           0      5085       -      15255        100.00   100.00%\n         1       5085     5386        5085      5386       -        903        100.00   100.00%\n\n\nRead alignment summary (2024-04-09 13:14:25)\nTotal read count:            1\nFully aligned reads:         1\nPartially aligned reads:     0\nUnaligned reads:             0\nTotal bases aligned:     5,386 bp\nMean alignment identity:   100.0%\n\nDeleting /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/97/working/read_alignment/\n\nSetting the minimum scaled score to the 5.0th percentile of full read alignments: 0.00\n\n\nBuilding long read bridges (2024-04-09 13:14:25)\n    Unicycler uses the long read alignments to produce bridges between anchor\nsegments.

Single-copy contigs (those with a multiplicity of one, occurring only\nonce in the underlying sequence) are particularly useful.\n    Multiplicity determination begins by identifying contigs which are clearly\nsingle-copy because they are of low depth and do not have more than one link\nper side.\n\nMedian depth of 10 longest contigs: 1.00\n\n\nInitial single copy segments:\n    1\n\n    Unicycler now uses a greedy algorithm to propagate multiplicity through the\ngraph. For example, if two single-copy contigs merge together, the resulting\ncontig will get a multiplicity of two. When no more propagation is possible,\nadditional single-copy contigs are added and the process is repeated. This\nallows for multiplicity to be correctly assigned to the chromosome (at the\nmedian depth) but also for plasmids (which may be higher or lower in depth).\n\n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n       FINDING NEW SINGLE-COPY        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \nREMOVING PROPAGATION TOLERANCE        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n\nSaving /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/100/working/001_best_spades_graph.gfa\n\n\nCleaning graph (2024-04-09 13:16:53)\n    Unicycler now performs various cleaning procedures on the graph to remove\noverlaps and simplify the graph structure.

It uses a wide range of many k-mer sizes to maximise the chance of\nfinding an ideal assembly.\n\nSPAdes maximum k-mer: 127\nMedian read length: 251\nK-mer range: 27, 47, 63, 77, 89, 99, 107, 115, 121, 127\n\n\nSPAdes assemblies (2024-04-09 13:15:13)\n    Unicycler now uses SPAdes to assemble the short reads. It scores the\nassembly graph for each k-mer using the number of contigs (fewer is better) and\nthe number of dead ends (fewer is better). The score function is 1/(c*(d+2)),\nwhere c is the contig count and d is the dead end count.\n\n== Warning ==  No assembly mode was specified!

Single-copy contigs (those with a multiplicity of one, occurring only\nonce in the underlying sequence) are particularly useful.\n    Multiplicity determination begins by identifying contigs which are clearly\nsingle-copy because they are of low depth and do not have more than one link\nper side.\n\nMedian depth of 10 longest contigs: 1.00\n\n\nInitial single copy segments:\n    1\n\n    Unicycler now uses a greedy algorithm to propagate multiplicity through the\ngraph. For example, if two single-copy contigs merge together, the resulting\ncontig will get a multiplicity of two. When no more propagation is possible,\nadditional single-copy contigs are added and the process is repeated. This\nallows for multiplicity to be correctly assigned to the chromosome (at the\nmedian depth) but also for plasmids (which may be higher or lower in depth).\n\n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n       FINDING NEW SINGLE-COPY        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \nREMOVING PROPAGATION TOLERANCE        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n\nSaving /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/100/working/001_best_spades_graph.gfa\n\n\nCleaning graph (2024-04-09 13:16:53)\n    Unicycler now performs various cleaning procedures on the graph to remove\noverlaps and simplify the graph structure.

It then uses the read depth of the\nmiddle and repeat contigs to guess the number of times to traverse the loop and\nmakes a bridge.\n\nNo loop unrolling bridges made\nnone found\n\n\nApplying bridges (2024-04-09 13:16:53)\n    Unicycler now applies to the graph in decreasing order of quality. This\nensures that when multiple, contradictory bridges exist, the most supported\noption is used.\n\nBridge type   Start -> end   Path   Quality   Result\n\nSaving /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/100/working/003_bridges_applied.gfa\n\n\nCleaning up leftover segments (2024-04-09 13:16:53)\nSegments eligible for deletion:\n\n\nBridged assembly graph (2024-04-09 13:16:53)\n    The assembly is now mostly finished and no more structural changes will be\nmade.
